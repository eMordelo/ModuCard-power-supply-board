## Features:

### Power section
- **Input voltage:** 65รท36V from the battery connection.
- **Output voltage:** ADR, 12V and 5V standby lines, drivable form MCU.

### ST-LINK
- Built-in **ST-LINK** connected to the backplane via USB interface.  
- Enables programming and debugging of the onboard MCU.

### CAN interface
- Two independent CAN buses: **CAN1** and **CAN2**.  
- Both connect with the backplane to facilitate communication between the onboard MCU and other modules in the system.
